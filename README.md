# OptimalErrorGuidance

#This project is a recreation of the results in Blackmore, Acikmese, and Schaf's  research paper: â€œMinimum-Landing-Error Powered-Descent Guidance for  Mars Landing Using Convex Optimization."
#
#I claim no credit for any of the original ideas presented. I have only written the code as a project to learn more about their work.
